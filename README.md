# Running locally

## TL;DR
Assuming that you are in a terminal window in the project's directory:
- Run the app: `npm i && npm start` and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Run the tests: `npm i && npm test`

The code coverage is displayed after the output of the tests.

---

### Requirements
- node.js and npm must be installed ([link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))
- from the command line,
  - navigate to the directory with the test 
  - and type: `npm install`

### Running the application
Assuming that you are in a terminal window in the project's directory:
- type: `npm start`
- you should get a new tab opened in your browser with the app. If it doesn't, 
  - open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### Running the tests
Assuming that you are in a terminal window in the project's directory:

- type: `npm test`
- you should see the tests in your terminal and at the end the coverage report

# Running from cloud

The test can also be checked online in CodeSandbox (cloud editor):

Disadvantage: The code coverage cannot be seen
